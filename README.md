## Q&A Section

### Q: Is there a shortcut key for Out of Body?
**A:** The F2 key controls the opening and closing of the Out-of-Body menu.

### Q: What is Out-of-Body? How do I use it?
**A:** The Out-of-Body function allows you to leave your body in one place while you can still walk, run, and jump normally. In this mode, you cannot open locks, interact with monsters, or be detected by monsters, but you can detect your body in its original place. You can also use remote pickup and teleportation to pick up and use items, allowing you to walk through obstacles.

### Q: How do I use Remote Pickup?
**A:** Enable the Out-of-Body function first. This allows you to pick up and use items in Out-of-Body mode. It can be used in conjunction with teleportation for quick pickups. The default key is the CAPS key; just hold it down to pick up the item.

### Q: How does Teleport work?
**A:** Enable the Out-of-Body function first. It is recommended to use this function with the "Draw Teleport Object" feature. The default key is the left ALT key; press it to teleport.

### Q: How do I use Flying?
**A:** Enable the Out-of-Body function first. The default keys are E or Q for ascending and descending, respectively.

### Q: What should I do if I suddenly become very fast after using Remote Pickup?
**A:** Press the CAPS key again. If the issue persists, press it twice.

### Q: What should I do if I encounter other bugs after using Remote Pickup?
**A:** Try the same solution as above. If the problem persists, turn off the Out-of-Body function and then turn it back on.
